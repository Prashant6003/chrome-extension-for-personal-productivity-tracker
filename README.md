This Chrome Extension is a personal productivity tracker built using React.js, designed to help users monitor and improve their daily work habits directly from the browser. The extension allows users to set goals, track time spent on various websites, and categorize activities as productive or unproductive. It features a clean and responsive React UI, real-time data visualization (e.g., pie charts, timelines), and local storage or Chrome Sync for persistent data. Users can receive alerts when exceeding time limits on distracting sites and view daily/weekly productivity reports. This tool aims to enhance focus, reduce procrastination, and promote mindful web usageâ€”all without leaving the browser.
